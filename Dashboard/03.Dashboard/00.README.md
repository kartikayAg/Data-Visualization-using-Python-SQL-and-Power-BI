# Dashboard: Power BI Analysis

## Introduction
In this folder, you'll find the Power BI dashboard created to analyze and understand the data extracted, transformed, and loaded in the previous steps.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides visual insights into the cleaned and organized data from the Superstore Sales dataset. It offers various visualizations and interactive elements to explore the dataset effectively.

## Connecting MySQL Server Database to Power BI
To connect the MySQL server database to Power BI and access the data for visualization, follow these steps:
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click on "Get Data" from the Home tab.
3. Select "MySQL Database" from the list of available data sources.
4. Enter the server details, including server name, database name, and credentials (username and password).
5. Click "OK" to establish the connection.
6. Choose the tables you want to import into Power BI.
7. Click "Load" to import the selected tables into Power BI for analysis.

**Note:**
Ensure that the MySQL server is running and accessible from your machine before attempting to connect. Also, it's worth mentioning that I chose the import option instead of direct query because the data in this project will not be changing.

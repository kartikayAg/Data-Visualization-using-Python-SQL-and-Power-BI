# Database Setup and Table Creation

## Introduction
In this folder, you'll find resources for setting up the database environment and creating tables based on the transformed data from the previous steps.

## MySQL User Creation Script
The SQL script provided creates a new MySQL user with the following credentials:
- **Username:** ADMIN
- **Password:** Password

This user will only be able to interact with databases created with ADMIN_ as a prefix, ensuring isolation from other projects.

## Extracted Data
After running the Extract and Transform script in the previous folder, you should find five CSV files in this folder. Each CSV file contains cleaned, filtered, and organized data from the original dataset, ready to be used for creating database tables.

## Table Creation Python Script
Additionally, you'll find a new Python script that utilizes the MySQL connector library. It performs the following tasks:
1. Connects to the newly created MySQL user.
2. Uses SQL language to create each of the tables in MySQL.
3. Inserts all the data into the created tables.

# **Note:** 
A complete database dump file is also provided in the "Database Dump" folder. You can run the SQL scripts directly on MySQL if preferred. Ensure to execute each SQL script in order to ensure the database is copied correctly with the correct table connections and all their data.
